Used STI for the separate APIs and avoided the common pitfall of wide tables by using Postgres' Hstore which also improved performance.

The .txt file is parsed and new items are inserted into the database. The use of Dropbox allows users to add ideas without being connected to the Internet and outside of the browser on multiple devices. Moved logic out of the views and controllers by using a presenter (app/presenters/sparks_presenter.rb).",

It takes in a directory full of images and converts them to 3x3 PDFs with company branding and photoshoot details. A task that would average 7 hours before was reduced to 30 minutes.",
