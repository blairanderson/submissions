A company with a philosophy that it's ok to make mistakes as long as you learn from them. I'm looking for a company that cares about best practices. A company that cares about our community and encourages community involvement through open source work, conference talks, and local meetups. I genuinely love to write code, solve challenging problems, and help my colleagues out. My goal is to find a like-minded team of developers. I want to work with a company that'll constantly push me outside of my comfort zone.",
