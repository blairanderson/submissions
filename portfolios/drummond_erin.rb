  :looking_for_description => "I'm looking for a company with a culture of mentoring new employees and enthusiastically encourages my growth and creativity in becoming a mature developer.  I would like to work for a company that thinks of its employees as more than just employees, but as part of the company family, and that encourages innovative new ideas from everyone.  I want to work in an environment where my co-workers are excited about the work they are doing, take pride in the code they write, have open communication practices, and celebrate team and individual successes.  I would like to find a place that has room for me to grow within the company, and offers positive and constructive feedback to help me become a strong developer.  Culturally speaking, spontaneous events like pub trivia nights on the history of the company or a beer and bacon party?  Yes, please - I'll even help you plan and execute it.",
