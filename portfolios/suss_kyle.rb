      :description => "User: admin@progressivedealer.com. Pass: password. Progressive dealer is the first step at creating a fully fledged automotive dealership management platform. This project tackled a few of the initial problems that I see within the current way things are run: measuring data integrity from a third-party data provider as well as monitoring the changes that are being made to data on a daily basis. Progressive Dealer imports a data feed that is distributed by a third party every day and sends this analytics information via email in a daily digest format so that the modern manager can act on important metrics.",

In this project, I set up the process for all of the background workers as well as implemented the model for retrieving data from Instagram via the API. Our final product was a travelogue that could keep track of posts on various social networks while someone is on a trip. That person could also follow others on the site as well as gain followers to their own personal profile.",

      :description => "Store Engine was my favorite project as the group dynamic was really strong. Being our first rails large project, we focused our efforts on learning how to use routes and adapt code to the MVC pattern. This project serves as a good starting point for the progress that we have made on Rails projects. Future projects had much more of a focus on keeping controllers slim and delegating work to the models, but we built a foundation for the structure of a RESTful app in this project.",
